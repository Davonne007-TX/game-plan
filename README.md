## Game Plan

- This is my game plan. My journey as a Frontend Developer making my way into the tech industry. My own way to keep track of my progress as I learn the necessary technical skills to land a role as a web developer.

- Its fun, its creative, and although its repetitive, I am having a lot of fun building it. It allows me to keep track of where I am and make side projects based off what I learn.

Lets Go..!

## Built in

- React.js and Tailwind CSS
