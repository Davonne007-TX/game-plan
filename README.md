## Game Plan

- This is my game plan. My journey as a Frontend Developer making my way into the tech industry. My own way to keep track of my progress as I learn React.js and the necessary skills to land a role as a web developer.

- Its fun, its creative, and although its repetitive, I am having a lot of fun building it. I also make side projects based off what I learn.

Lets Go..!

## Built in

- React.js and Tailwind CSS
