## Game Plan

- This is my game plan. My own way to keep track of my progress as I
  learn the necessary technical skills to land a role as a web developer.

- Its fun, its creative, and although its repetitive, I am having a lot of fun building it and allows me to keep track of where I am.

## Built in

- React.js and Tailwind CSS
