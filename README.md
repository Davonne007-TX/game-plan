## Game Plan

- This is my game plan. My journey as a Frontend Developer making my way into the tech industry. My own way to keep track of my progress as I learn React.js, my goals, and plan to level up as a developer and land a role.

- Its fun, its creative, and I am having a lot of fun building it. I also make side projects based off what I learn.

## Built in

- React.js and Tailwind CSS

## Resources

- React.dev: https://react.dev/learn

- Featured tutorials from Shruti Kapoor, ThisDotMedia and more.

- Github Copoilot
