  Title: Unraveling UX vs UI vs product design

  Florian Bolter: UI/UX Designer

  - Design is problem solving
  - We design the solution
  - effective solutions
  
  - Apps:
     - so many problems in the little things: ex. app icons 

  ** Always user centered, and business orientated ***

  In a nut shell:
- Problem Solving
- User Centered
- Communication
- Aesthetics and Functionality: Creating something that works well
- Process 

"Design is not ART and ART is not Design"

- Design is problematic and solving problems 

- Design is more like a science 


UX Design:
 - Understanding 
   - understand what the user needs
   - what the motivations are of the user 
 - Journey
   - what is the journey for the user to get to the product
   - steam less experience 
 - Testing
   - test the design for developers
   - can come up with a design faster they can code it 
 - Research
   - user interviews 
   - surveys
   - focus groups 
 - Architecture
 - Ideation 

 UI Design:
  - Aesthetics
    - visual pleasing 
  - Interaction 
    - determining how the user interacts with an application or website. ex Forms are easy but people mess up designing forms 
    - can they navigate through your site 
  - Consistency
    - paddings are consistent 
    - forms are consistent throughout site 
    - 
  - Details
    - care about the details 
    - determine the transitions between the pages
    - any effect when you open a drop down
    - determining where animations are placed 
  - Building Systems
    - building a design system
    - defining our styles, defining our padding basically like a plan before, a system you follow 
  - Polish
    - iconography, visual design, last finishing touches, 

Product Design:
 - Bundling Efforts
  - combining UX and UI and business activities to work end to end
  - kinda like in charge, can do it all, from the business side 
  - coming up with game plan for UX and UI 
  - overseeing what the UX and UI are doing 
  - balance what you need to do for the given timeline 
- Balancing  User and & Business
 - Finding common ground and making trade-offs 
 - Don't make it too hard to build 
 - Make things better for the business if we do one thing over the other 
 - to do something else but still good for a business 
- Visionary
  - the big picture thinking
  - what is the general purpose
  - what are we trying to solve
  - where can this product be in a year 
- UX Activities
 - Research, testing, ideation, mapping, content 
- UI Activities
  - visual designs, design systems, advanced prototyping
- Business Activities 
 - stakeholders management and project management 
  roadmap planning
    - again have to talk to stakeholders
    - you have a say in the product design ,., its in the name 
 - talk to stakeholders
 - business knows what the problems are
 - keep stakeholders in the loop
 - what does the solution look like 
 - the overall big vision of the Product
 

 If you have all three:
  - a product team, will have one of each, dedicated areas of expertise

***********************
- How often do ui/ux interact with developers?
 - ideally you would engage with them
 - constraints you have when you design the solution 
 - can we actually do this, is this way to complicated to build, interact with developers at the hand off,
 - this is documented, can be beneficial to have a meeting
 - don't talk every day but do go to their stand ups to see what they are doing with my design
 - beginning, middle and end? 
 - memes about design and developers not working together
 - have common ground with them
 - all developers are open 
 - have the view of designing a good solution and they know they can code what they design  ***


 - have a foundation knowledge of all ux, ui, product design. You can do it all but try to specialize.

   - 30-40% to writing
