    What I would like to go over
   
    -   Internal Agreements:
        Draft internal agreements that outline how projects will be distributed,
         who will take the lead on each project, and how profits and expenses will
        be shared among the members.

      -  Project Allocation:
         Clearly define how projects will be allocated among the members. This could
         involve rotating responsibilities, taking turns on projects, or assigning
          projects based on individual strengths and expertise.
        
    -  Independence on Projects:
        Define the level of independence each member has on their assigned projects.
        If each member is expected to handle their projects without direct
        collaboration, ensure that this is communicated and agreed upon.

    -  Collaboration Opportunities:
       While each member may work independently on their projects, consider opportunities
       for collaboration on certain aspects, such as sharing resources, knowledge, or 
       providing feedback and support.

    -  Brand Consistency:
        Maintain consistency in the branding and image of the business, especially
        if you are collectively representing yourselves as a cohesive entity.
        This includes the design and messaging on the business's website.
    
    - Client Communication:
        Establish a protocol for client communication. Even if each member is working
        independently, having a unified approach to client interactions can help
        maintain a professional and cohesive image for the business.

    - Project Ownership and Intellectual Property:
        Clearly define the ownership of projects and intellectual property rights.
         Determine whether each member retains ownership of their projects or if
        there's a collective ownership structure for the work produced under the 
        business name.
         
    -  Conflict Resolution:
        Implement a process for resolving conflicts or disagreements within
        the business. This could involve regular meetings, open communication
        channels, and a mechanism for addressing any disputes that may arise.
