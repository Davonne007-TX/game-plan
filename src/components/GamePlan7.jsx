              This is the focus right now. I know JavaScript is a powerful
              language. I want to stick to what I am good at. And I excel in
              Frontend Development. I want to be really good at what I do. So
              the goal is Javascript, React.js, of course HTML, CSS. As well as
              accessibility and diving into UI/UX. Baby steps. But the main goal
              after all this is to build a full stack app. I am familiar with
              the PERN stack so that is what I am going to do.

              I would need to think of a quality project I would want to. That
              would ultimately be on my resume. I want to be able to say Thank
              You Javascript. With all this in mind, I need to think about what
              stack is in my area. I know Java is popular as well TypeScript. It
              would be a good idea to implement TypeScript in my project. If
              this is what it takes to land a job, I am all in.
