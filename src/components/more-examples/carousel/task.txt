Task: CAROUSEL/SLIDESHOW COMPONENT 

* You are tasked with building a responsive and accessible carousel/slideshow component in
React. The component should support looping functionality, smooth CSS transitions, and an
auto play feature that allows slides to advance automatically. 

 * Requirements

Core Functionality
• Display a list of images or content slides in a horizontal layout.

• Allow users to navigate slides using previous/next buttons and dot indicators.

• Implement looping functionality so the carousel seamlessly transitions from the last
slide back to the rst and vice versa.

• Support autop lay mode, where slides advance automatically after a set interval.

• Pause auto play when the user interacts with the carousel (hover, focus, or manual
navigation).

• Ensure the carousel is keyboard-accessible and supports ARIA roles and attributes for
accessibility.
