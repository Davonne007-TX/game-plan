    description: `Destructive force of nature. When conditions are right, they can do a lot of damage. 
        Tornaods are a super intense, spinning column of air that comes down from a thunderstorm and touches
         the ground. Ranging from an EF1 to EF5 based on wind speed and damge caused. When a tornado comes, get 
         to the lowest level of your house, like a basement. Get inside an interior room, such as a bathroom tub or
         closet. Stay as far away from windows. Stay alert of weather alerts on your phone. Shoes ready. Head down.
         You can also have an helment, a matress, anything to protect your self. Put as many walls between you and the
         outside.`,

    description: `Powerful energy in the sky. Rain.  Thunder. Lightning.Sometimes it even brings hail. It happens when warm,
         moist air rises and mixes with cooler air up in the sky, creating big clouds that can explode with energy—boom! That’s
         the thunder. And the lightning? That’s electricity flashing through the sky. When there is a thunderstom go inside, stay 
         away from windows, watch for local news and alerts, avoid water, and try your best to not use wired electronics. If you are
         outside. Try your best to get indoors, stay away from fields, aviod water, find a car, crouch low like a ball, and stay away 
         from metal.`,
