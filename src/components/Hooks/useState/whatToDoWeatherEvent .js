    description: `Destructive force of nature. When conditions are right, they can do a lot of damage. 
        Tornaods are a super intense, spinning column of air that comes down from a thunderstorm and touches
         the ground. Ranging from an EF1 to EF5 based on wind speed and damge caused. When a tornado comes, get 
         to the lowest level of your house, like a basement. Get inside an interior room, such as a bathroom tub or
         closet. Stay as far away from windows. Stay alert of weather alerts on your phone. Shoes ready. Head down.
         You can also have an helment, a matress, anything to protect your self. Put as many walls between you and the
         outside.`,

    description: `Powerful energy in the sky. Rain.  Thunder. Lightning.Sometimes it even brings hail. It happens when warm,
         moist air rises and mixes with cooler air up in the sky, creating big clouds that can explode with energy—boom! That’s
         the thunder. And the lightning? That’s electricity flashing through the sky. When there is a thunderstom go inside, stay 
         away from windows, watch for local news and alerts, avoid water, and try your best to not use wired electronics. If you are
         outside. Try your best to get indoors, stay away from fields, aviod water, find a car, crouch low like a ball, and stay away 
         from metal.`,

    name: "Hurricanes",
    description: `Very strog force of nature. Categorized by wind speed, ranging from Category 1 through 5. A hurricane is a huge, powerful
     storm that forms over warm ocean water. It’s like a giant spinning machine made of wind, rain, and clouds. When it hits land, it can
     cause massive damage with strong winds, heavy flooding, and even tornadoes. Hurricanes can cause major damge and life threatening conditions. 
     Listen to local authourties and weather alerts. If evacuations are in place, please leave and bring your pets. During a hurricane, it's important
     to be prepared, stay safe, and know what to do before, during, and after the storm. Before the hurricane hits, make sure you know if you're in
     an evacuation zone and follow any orders to leave. Prepare an emergency kit with food, water, flashlights, batteries, medications, and important
     documents.`,
    moreDescription: ` Board up your windows, bring in outdoor furniture, and make sure your phone and backup batteries are fully charged. During the storm,
     stay indoors and away from windows—go to a small interior room like a closet or bathroom. Use flashlights instead of candles to avoid fire risk,
     and keep up with weather updates using a battery-powered radio or phone if service is available. After the storm, stay inside until it’s confirmed
    safe to go out. Watch out for downed power lines, flooded areas, and other hazards. Don’t drink tap water unless officials say it’s safe. Check on your
     loved ones.`,
